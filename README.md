## Problem statement 
Step into the future of urban surveillance with our groundbreaking intelligent system, fueled by advanced computer vision algorithms through our trained model equipped cameras strategically placed across city streets. Our solution leverages the cutting-edge capabilities of YOLOv8, delivering swift and precise detection of incidents such as theft, chain snatching, and illicit activities in real-time. But our vision extends beyond mere detection; we prioritize seamless integration with local authorities, ensuring rapid response and effective collaboration to maintain public safety.

- We leverage YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to analyze video feeds in real-time.
Flowchart: See Flowchart  for the process of monitoring video feeds and detecting incidents using YOLOv8.

- Customizable Threshold for Confidence Score:
We implement a threshold mechanism to filter out detections with confidence scores below a certain threshold.
Flowchart: Refer to Flowchart  to understand how confidence scores are evaluated and filtered.

- Automated Alert Generation and Dispatch:
Upon detecting an incident, the system automatically extracts relevant information and crafts an alert message.
Flowchart: Flowchart  illustrates the process of incident information extraction, alert message crafting, and dispatch to emergency services.
